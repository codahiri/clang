# C Language

### `C` is a general-purpose programming language that has been around for nearly 50 years.

### `C` has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more. The versatility of C is by design. It is a low-level language that relates closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn.

> Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming language.
